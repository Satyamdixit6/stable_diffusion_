# Stable Diffusion Model

Welcome to my Stable Diffusion Model project! This model is designed for high-quality text-to-image generation, leveraging advanced diffusion techniques to create stunning visuals from textual descriptions.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Stable Diffusion Model** is a latent diffusion model that generates images based on text prompts. It employs a combination of neural networks and diffusion processes to create high-resolution images efficiently. The model is particularly notable for its ability to generate diverse and realistic images.

### Key Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generates images from textual descriptions using a pretrained CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder.
- **Latent Diffusion**: Operates in a latent space, allowing for efficient training and sampling.
- **High Resolution**: Capable of producing images at 512x512 resolution with high fidelity.

## üìö Theory Behind the Model

### Diffusion Process

The diffusion model operates by gradually adding noise to an image and then learning to reverse this process to recover the original image. The key components include:

- **Forward Process**: This involves adding Gaussian noise to the image over a series of time steps, effectively transforming the image into pure noise.
  
- **Reverse Process**: The model learns to denoise the image step-by-step, guided by the text prompt. This is where the sampling techniques come into play.

### Sampling Techniques

One of the primary sampling techniques used in this model is **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**. The formula for the reverse process can be expressed as:

$$
p_{\theta}(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_{\theta}(x_t, t), \Sigma_{\theta}(x_t, t))
$$

Where:
- $$x_t$$ is the noisy image at time step $$t$$.
- $$\mu_{\theta}(x_t, t)$$ is the predicted mean of the denoised image.
- $$\Sigma_{\theta}(x_t, t)$$ is the predicted variance.

The model is trained to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual noise added during the forward process.

## üé® Usage

To generate images using the Stable Diffusion Model, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("your_model_path")
image = pipe("A beautiful landscape with mountains and a river").images[0]
image.save("generated_image.png")
```
